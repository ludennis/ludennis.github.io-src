&lt;p&gt;This is my first time hearing and learning Kalman Filter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was getting into Udacity's Linear Algebra Refresh Course in lesson 4, the topic of Kalman Filter was brought up, and no previous lessons in the course have introduced nor explained it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So upon Googling it, I have found that MatLab's company MathWorks have some videos about it here:
&lt;code&gt;https://www.mathworks.com/videos/series/understanding-kalman-filters.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I got from the first video, Kalman Filter is basically an algorithm that estimates a value that cannot be directly captured, but by other sources that are indirectly related to it. One of the example the tutorial uses is to show how Kalman Filter is used in estimating the location of a car when only the gyroscope and the odometer were available in the absent of GPS. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="linearalgebra"></category><category term="math"></category><category term="learning"></category></entry></feed>
