# My Experience of Setting Up Pelican

So I was doing Udacity's **machine learning nanodegree** and in
one of the lessons `pelican` was mentioned. Having never setted 
up a personal blog, I dipped into the nitty details and got some
experience to make my own site on gihubpage with the help of 
some others who have already made the personal page with 
`pelican`

## Setting Up My Environment

### Miniconda

### pip [packages]

## Pelican

### Installing Pelican

### writing content 

### outputing the html websites

## GitHub Page

### username.github.io

### username.github.io-src
